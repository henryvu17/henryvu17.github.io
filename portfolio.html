        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The story behind this game was for my partner and I to make a game that resembles the 1942 Arcade Game but, a 2D type of side scroller.<br>
        The start of the game shows megaman trying to fight of robot enemies due to a robot, alien, and underworld invasion. Scoring was on the count of hits.<br>
        Random selection occurs as the enemy spawns. The game gets harder as time goes by. The user loses when they hit 0 HP never ending, intended to win by hit points.</p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p> The point of making this game was influenced by the Arcade Game 1942. The Most successful part of the game was the difficulty over time.<br>
        If more time was given, the general ending and continuation of the story would be improved and gameplay.</p>

        <p>In the first picture that is the most important factor to the game, and character costume change, without it the player will just end up<br>
        looking the same and everything will just look like a picture sliding. The 2nd one is shooting, and the change of the costume with it. </p>
